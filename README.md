# Chuck-Norrisized-react-app-with-docker
A dockerized react app which is a client for the public api which returns Chuck Norris jokes, but please remember that Chuck Norris will never be in a container, the container will be in Chuck Norris.

Disclaimer: I am in no way associated with the team which made the Chuck Norris Public API, this project is just calling the API, the credit for making the API belongs to that team. This is just a project which calls it.

It was supposed to be  a simple project to just see how it feels working on a react app while having it in a container, but then I started adding stuff to it (make it prettier, add routing, making sure to call endpoints).


# Project structure 
The project is split into 3 folders: 
- one for the react app itself (chuck-norris-react)
- one for any code related to docker 
- one for the docs
